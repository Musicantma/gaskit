# Gaskit

Gaskit a git-backed issue tracker. It uses a branch in your local git database to store the tickets.

## Current Status

Gaskit was created as a proof of concept for using Git as a database for an application. It currently only runs against itself. To see what else needs done, clone the repo and run the app.

## Running the app

    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rackup
